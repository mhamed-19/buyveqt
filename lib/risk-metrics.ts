/**
 * Drawdown / recovery helpers for the /compare ledger.
 *
 * "Max drawdown" is the deepest peak-to-trough drop in a price series.
 * It's the metric that answers the question that actually matters
 * during a bear market: "how much pain did I have to sit through to
 * collect this return?" Two funds with identical 5-year returns can
 * have very different drawdown profiles, and the one that bottomed
 * out 35% will feel completely different from the one that bottomed
 * out 22% — even if they end at the same place.
 *
 * "Recovery days" is the calendar-day count from the trough back to a
 * new all-time high. Or "still recovering" if the fund hasn't gotten
 * there yet. Together these two numbers tell the story of the worst
 * stretch of holding the fund.
